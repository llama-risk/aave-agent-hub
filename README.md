# Aave Agent Hub

The Aave Agent Hub is a middleware between RiskOracle and the protocol where the update from RiskOracle needs to be injected.

## Aave Agent Hub Key Components:

### [AgentHub](src/contracts/AgentHub.sol):

The AgentHub acts as an orchestrator for multiple agents and is a single big monolith contract that holds all the common logic:

- Querying from RiskOracle
- Access Control Checks
- GenericValidation
  - Circuit Breakers, if disabled or not.
  - Validating if update expired or not.
  - Validating if update already executed.
  - Validating if minimum delay has passed since last executed.

*Note: For agentValidation (validation specific to the protocol) and injection, the AgentHub does an external call to the configured agent contract.*

The AgentHub also holds all the configurations for the agent with access control for the agent admin to update configs.

The AgentHub is a hub for multiple agents which can have different configurations specific to a protocol. Ex. one agent for doing supplyCapUpdate, another agent for doing slopeOneUpdate and so on.

The AgentHub has 2 main methods: `check()` and `execute()` which can be used to support both push and pull base architecture.
The `check()` method is called to check if for an agent update can be injected, and the `execute()` method is to be called to inject / push the update from the RiskOracle into the protocol.

#### Inheritance Structure

The diagram below illustrates the inheritance and dependency relationships of the AgentHub:

### [Agents](src/contracts/agent):

Agents are independent contracts that contain all the logic specific to the protocol.

An Agent corresponds to only one `updateType` from the RiskOracle and multiple markets, this is to ensure the agent contains logic only for the specific updateType ex. a single agent contract for `supplyCap` update across all listed assets on Aave.

Agents follow a common interface having these two main methods: `validate()` and `inject()` which are to be called by the AgentHub for doing specific validation to the agent for ex. RangeValidation for interest rate changes and so on and injection on the protocol.

Agents also have a `getMarkets()` method to use markets which are dynamic in nature, for markets which is not easy to configure directly on the AgentHub.

Agents are designed to be light-weight contracts as they will be deployed quite often and will contain only specific logic for the update.

### [Common Modules](src/contracts/modules):

The common modules are contracts that will be deployed once and used by multiple agents across hubs. Some examples of common modules will be:

- **[RangeValidationModule](src/contracts/modules/RangeValidationModule.sol)**: Independent immutable contract which contains logic to validate range and also holds range configurations with access contract for different hubs and agents. The range validation module can be used inside your `validate()` method on your agent contract to validate param ranges, the configuration can be set on the range validation module directly for your agent.
Please note: you can specify both default range configuration which will be common to all markets, and also configuration specific to a market. In case the configuration does not exists for a specific market the module will fallback to use the default configuration for all the markets.

Once you have registered your agent on the AgentHub, you can call `setRangeConfigByMarket()` and `setDefaultRangeConfig()` method to set range configuration for your agent.

## Access Control

The AgentHub system implements a hierarchical permissions model to ensure secure and controlled access to different functionalities:

### Primary Actors

### Secondary Actors

<details>

- **Capabilities**:
  - Produce risk parameter updates of various types
- **Trust Assumptions**:
  - Significant trust required as the source of risk parameters.
  - To minimise the trust given of RiskOracle, we have strict validation on the agent side with range validation, minimum delays and so on.

</details>

### [Threat Modeling](docs/ThreatModeling.md)

### Key Access Control Points

- **Agent Registration**: Only the hub owner can register new agents via `registerAgent()` with the `onlyOwner` modifier
- **Agent Configuration**: Only the agent admin and hub owner can modify agent settings through the `onlyOwnerOrAgentAdmin` modifier
- **Update Execution**: Controlled by the `isAgentPermissioned` flag and permissioned senders list, checked during `execute()`
- **Protocol Interaction**: Permissions for protocol updates are granted to the agent contract i.e `agentAddress`, not the hub

### [Configuration and Deployment Guide](docs/ConfigurationGuide.md)

### FAQ's:

**Case of existing setup in production**

1. I have a Hub and multiple agents configured in production, but I'm upgrading my protocol and need to adapt the logic of how my Hub and     Agents interact with it. What do I need to do?

    New agent contracts with the latest protocol changes needs to be deployed first. Once we have the new agent contracts, the protocol specific roles given to old agent contracts should be revoked and the roles given to the new agent contract. The hub owner should now change the agentContract using the `setAgentAddress()` setter for all the agents.

2. There is a new version of the Hub that I would like to upgrade to, what implications it have/what do I need to do considering that I have multiple agents in production?

    Considering the latest version of Hub has no breaking changes, the latest version of the Hub implementation needs to be deployed, and using the ProxyAdmin of the Hub proxy, the new implementation of Hub should be set.

3. There is a new general module that I would like to plug to my agents, what should I do?

    If you store the module address as immutables on the agent contract you would need to redeploy the agent and set the new agent address using the `setAgentAddress()`
    However, if you store the address of the module in AgentContext as bytes, you would need to update the AgentContext with the new bytes encoded module address and set it using `setAgentContext()` setter without any redeployment of agent contract.

**Misc**

1. I have want to have an agent with multiple updateTypes, what can I do?

  Each agent on the AgentHub corresponds to only one updateType and multiple markets of the RiskOracle. If you wish to have multiple updateTypes, you can register multiple agents on the hub. Please note: you can re-use the agentContract across multiple agents by doing some abstraction on the agentContract.

2. What happens if we have multiple updates on the RiskOracle and a lot of them or all are over the expiration period? Can it block the system? If so, how to unblock the system by the admin?

    If the updates from the RiskOracle is expired and blocked, the agent admin can increase the expiration period to unblock the updates using the `setExpirationPeriod()` setter.

3. How is the configuration flow of ranges configs? E.g. in an "open-market" system where the list of all markets on an agent is dynamically changing.

    On the RangeValidationModule, we configure the range configs for all default markets using the `setDefaultRangeConfig()` setter. This range config will be used for all markets unless overridden. For only a specific market if a different range config needs to be configured, it can be done using the `setRangeConfigByMarket()` setter. So if the range config is not set for a specific market, it fallbacks to the default range config.

## Audits

The Solidity code in this repository (`src/`, `tests/`, `scripts/`) is byte-identical to the audited Chaos Agents codebase at commit [`f02af714ef069e54bae577ac2d34bb3d57d6e1cd`](https://github.com/aave-dao/chaos-agents/tree/f02af714ef069e54bae577ac2d34bb3d57d6e1cd) of [aave-dao/chaos-agents](https://github.com/aave-dao/chaos-agents), a direct fork of `ChaosLabsInc/chaos-agents` — the repository referenced in the audit reports. The existing audits therefore carry over:

- [Hexens](./audits/hexens/v1-hexens.pdf)
- [Zellic](./audits/zellic/v1-zellic.pdf)

Only documentation and naming were changed as part of the migration ("Chaos Agents" → "Aave Agent Hub"); no contract code was modified.
